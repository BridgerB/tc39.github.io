## Current Proposals



## What is the Javascript Specification?

The ECMAScript specification, known colloquially as the Javascript specification or JS Spec is the formal standard which outlines a vendor (browsers and other implementations) neutral programming language for the behavior of the web. The specification is standardized by the TC39 (Technical committee 39) of ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association). You can read our mission statement (here)[https://ecma-international.org/memento/TC39-M.htm].

## How?

Specifying a language is a complex process. We have a [four stage process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) with a rolling release schedule with a new specification published every year.

## Want to Get Involved?
To get involved with the committee on an organizational level, read our [Joining the TC39](https://ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm#Scope) documentation. However there are many opportunities to get involved on an individual level. Check out our [Contributor Documentation](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [guides]() to learn more.
